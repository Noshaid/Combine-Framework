## Swift: Combine Basics & Intro

In this example we will learn about the basics of the Apple Combine framework with swift and iOS. Combine is Apple's own reactive data framework similar to RxSwift and Redux. Its useful and especially interesting to integrate with SwiftUI.

- **Future** (A publisher that eventually produces a single value and then finishes or fails)
- **PassthroughSubject** A subject that broadcasts elements to downstream subscribers. As a concrete implementation of `Subject`, the `PassthroughSubject` provides a convenient way to adapt existing imperative code to the Combine model. Unlike `CurrentValueSubject`, a `PassthroughSubject` doesnâ€™t have an initial value or a buffer of the most recently-published element. A `PassthroughSubject` drops values if there are no subscribers, or its current demand is zero.
